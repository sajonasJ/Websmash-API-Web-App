He was able to do all task . The rest of the tasks are working well and can discuss global and local variables. Marks 1.5
Review by Alexander to Jonas Sajonas
Jonas was clear in explaining his code and had a lot of commented lines which made it very readable for a third party. He completed all tasks that were assigned. I award him full 1.5 marks.

Reflection: 
I was able to complete all task and do and able to show the search value match with the figure captions. I was able to discuss global and local variables and their scopes. I intend to research more about other methods how to make my code simpler and readable.
